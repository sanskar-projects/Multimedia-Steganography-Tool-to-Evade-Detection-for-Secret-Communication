# Multimedia Steganography Tool to Evade Detection for Secret Communication Based on LSB Steganography and Fernet Encryption
The system is a web-based application developed using the Flask framework that enables users to hide and retrieve messages within images, audio, or text files, along with encryption for enhanced security. The platform provides an end-to-end solution for secure data concealment using steganography, and the use of symmetric encryption (AES) or other cryptographic methods adds a strong layer of protection. Users can choose between different data types (text, image, or audio) and corresponding carrier media to embed or extract hidden content. The application integrates well-structured HTML templates, Flask routing, Python-based steganography libraries, and JavaScript for improved interactivity. It consists of three main modules: data input and media selection, steganographic embedding and extraction, and encryption/decryption.
