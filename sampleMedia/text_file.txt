Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,
dispenser of India's destiny.
Thy name rouses the hearts of the Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat and Maratha.
of the Dravida, Orissa and Bengal.
It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas, mingles in the music of the Yamuna and Ganges
and is chanted by the waves of the Indian Ocean.
They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise.
The saving of all people waits in thy hand,
thou dispenser of India's destiny.
Victory, Victory, Victory to thee.
